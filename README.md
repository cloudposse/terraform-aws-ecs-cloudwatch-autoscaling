[![Terraform Open Source Modules](https://docs.cloudposse.com/images/terraform-open-source-modules.svg)][terraform_modules]



It's 100% Open Source and licensed under the [APACHE2](LICENSE).







We literally have [*hundreds of terraform modules*][terraform_modules] that are Open Source and well-maintained. Check them out! 







## Usage


**IMPORTANT:** The `master` branch is used in `source` just as an example. In your code, do not pin to `master` because there may be breaking changes between releases.
Instead pin to the release tag (e.g. `?ref=tags/x.y.z`) of one of our [latest releases](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-ecs-cloudwatch-autoscaling/releases).



For a complete example, see [examples/complete](examples/complete).

For automated tests of the complete example using `bats` and `Terratest`, see [test](test).

```hcl
module "ecs_cloudwatch_autoscaling" {
  source                = "git::https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-ecs-cloudwatch-autoscaling.git?ref=master"
  namespace             = "eg"
  stage                 = "staging"
  name                  = "app"
  service_name          = "eg-staging-example-service"
  cluster_name          = "eg-staging-example-cluster"
  min_capacity          = 1
  max_capacity          = 2
  scale_up_adjustment   = 1
  scale_up_cooldown     = 60
  scale_down_adjustment = -1
  scale_down_cooldown   = 300
}
```




## Examples

For a complete usage example, see [terraform-aws-ecs-web-app module](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-ecs-web-app/blob/master/main.tf).
